# Completed Tasks - FastAPI Enterprise Baseline

**Document Version**: 1.0.0  
**Last Updated**: 2025-10-05

## Phase 1 – Critical Fixes

### 1. Fix Test Suite Configuration and Imports
- Analyzed failing tests and removed deprecated fixtures until `uv run pytest` executed end-to-end in a clean workspace.
- Rebuilt pytest async fixtures to use per-test SQLite databases seeded via `.venv` isolation.
- Restored deterministic green runs for the full suite (unit, integration, oauth) prior to new repository migration.

### 2. Complete Core Service Implementations
- Raised `UserService` coverage above 80% with focused unit tests for password rotation, activation toggles, and OAuth linking.
- Introduced a dedicated auth service that consolidates local login, token exchange, and refresh flows.
- Added docstrings and validation guards for newly exposed service methods.

## Phase 2 – Monitoring & Observability (Partial)
- Adopted structured JSON logging with compliance metadata emitted via `python-json-logger` + `structlog` pipeline.
- Upgraded health endpoints with detailed telemetry, configuration probes, and readiness/liveness splitting.
