**Context**: UserService was well-implemented but service layer had low coverage  
**Outcome**: Identified service completion as high priority  
**Application**: Invest in service layer design and implementation  

**Key Insight**: Service layer is where business logic lives. Poor service layer = poor maintainability.

### 2. Async-First Design Benefits
**Lesson**: Async patterns throughout the stack provide performance benefits  
**Context**: Project uses async consistently from API to database  
**Outcome**: Good performance characteristics and resource utilization  
**Application**: Design for async from the beginning, not as an afterthought  

**Key Insight**: Async is not just about performance—it's about resource efficiency and user experience.

### 3. Type Safety Investment
