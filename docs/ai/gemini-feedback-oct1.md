Excellent progress. The codebase has moved from a strong but unstable foundation to a stable, reliable, and truly seamless starting point. The recent updates have addressed all the critical issues that were previously hindering the developer experience. The test suite is now passing, and major deprecation warnings have been resolved, significantly improving the project's quality and future-readiness.

Key Improvements
Test Suite Stabilized: The most critical issue—the failing test suite—has been resolved. As noted in the updated todo.md, all 28 tests are now passing. The test database fixtures now correctly seed data, allowing the OAuth and user-related tests to execute successfully. This is a major milestone that restores confidence in the CI/CD pipeline and the overall stability of the boilerplate.

Deprecation Warnings Addressed: You have successfully removed the key deprecation warnings, bringing the code in line with modern best practices:

Timezone-Aware Timestamps: The use of datetime.utcnow has been replaced with the recommended datetime.now(timezone.utc) across the models, such as in user.py. This ensures all timestamps are timezone-aware and avoids future compatibility issues.
Pydantic V2 Compliance: The deprecated json_encoders in Pydantic schemas have been removed, aligning the project with the current Pydantic v2 standards.
Remaining Opportunities & Next Steps
With the foundational stability now in place, the project is well-positioned for further enhancements. The updated todo.md provides a clear path forward.

Increase Test Coverage:

Status: While the existing tests are passing, overall coverage is still at 72%.
Recommendation: The next logical step is to focus on the "Increase Test Coverage" section of your to-do list. Prioritize writing new unit and integration tests for the modules with the lowest coverage, such as database.py and the authentication endpoints in auth.py. This will harden the boilerplate against future regressions.
Continuous Documentation & DX Refinement:

Status: The setup scripts and documentation are in a good state.
Recommendation: As you continue to add features, ensure the README.md and setup scripts (scripts) are kept in sync. A frictionless setup is a key feature of a successful boilerplate, and maintaining it should remain a priority.
You have successfully transformed this project into a polished and dependable template. The focus can now shift from stabilization to feature enhancement and broader test coverage.
