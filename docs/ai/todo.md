**Blocking**: None

#### 6. Add Strawberry GraphQL API ⚠️ PENDING
**Priority**: Medium  
**Estimated Effort**: 6-8 hours

**Sub-tasks**:
- [ ] Install Strawberry and supporting dependencies
- [ ] Model GraphQL schema for core resources (users, auth metadata)
- [ ] Expose GraphQL endpoint with async context tied to FastAPI application lifecycle

**Dependencies**: Stable auth/session handling  
**Blocking**: None

#### 7. Implement Endpoint RBAC ⚠️ PENDING
**Priority**: High  
**Estimated Effort**: 5-7 hours

**Sub-tasks**:
- [ ] Define role model (e.g., admin, manager, user) in schema and database
- [ ] Add role claims to issued JWTs and ensure refresh flow persists roles
- [ ] Create reusable dependency that checks roles per endpoint/tag
- [ ] Apply RBAC rules to sensitive routes (user management, admin actions)
- [ ] Add tests covering role enforcement and failure cases

**Dependencies**: Updated user/service layer, functioning auth flow  
**Blocking**: Service refactor work

## Completed Tasks

### ✅ Documentation Reorganization (2025-01-25)
- Merged architecture_old.md content into architecture.md
- Deleted redundant documentation files (oauth2-consolidation-summary.md, oauth2-integration.md)
- Updated README.md with correct OAuth endpoint paths
- Updated spec.md authentication flow to match implementation
- Created feature documentation index at docs/features/README.md
- Updated all documentation to reflect current codebase state

### ✅ Documentation Foundation (2025-01-25)
- Created comprehensive project documentation structure
- Established living document pattern
- Set up tracking and decision logging framework

## Upcoming Tasks (Phase 2)

### Enterprise Features Implementation
**Start Date**: After Phase 1 completion  
**Priority**: High

#### Rate Limiting Implementation
- [ ] Install slowapi dependency
- [ ] Create RateLimitingMiddleware
- [ ] Configure per-endpoint limits
- [ ] Add Redis backend for distributed limiting
- [ ] Add rate limit error handling

#### Caching Layer
- [ ] Install FastAPI-cache and Redis
- [ ] Create caching decorators
- [ ] Implement query result caching

## Blocked Tasks

None currently.

## Deferred Tasks

### OAuth Credentials Security
**Original Issue**: Google OAuth credentials in .env  
**Decision**: Defer to Phase 2 when implementing secrets management  
**Reason**: User requested to keep current setup for now

## Metrics and Goals

### Phase 1 Success Criteria
- [ ] All tests passing (currently 0/138)
- [ ] Service layer coverage >80% (currently 19%)
- [ ] Modern tooling configured (ruff)
- [ ] Python 3.12 features utilized
- [ ] Documentation complete and current

### Time Tracking
- **Phase 1 Start**: 2025-01-25
- **Target Completion**: End of Week 1
- **Time Spent**: 2 hours (documentation)
- **Remaining Estimate**: 12-16 hours

### Risk Assessment
- **High Risk**: Test suite complexity may require more time than estimated
- **Medium Risk**: Service implementations may reveal architectural issues
- **Low Risk**: Ruff migration should be straightforward

## Daily Standup Format

### What was completed yesterday?
- Created comprehensive documentation structure
- Established project specifications and architecture

### What will be worked on today?
- Complete documentation (actions.md, lessons.md)
- Begin test suite analysis and fixes

### What blockers exist?
- None currently identified

## Notes and Decisions

### Decision Log
1. **Documentation First Approach**: Decided to create comprehensive docs before implementation to ensure proper tracking and decision recording per CLAUDE.md requirements.

2. **Test Suite Priority**: Made fixing tests the highest priority since all development depends on having a working test suite.

3. **Ruff Migration**: Chosen over incremental tooling updates based on expert recommendations for 10-100x performance improvement.

### Lessons Learned
1. **Documentation Value**: Creating comprehensive docs upfront provides clarity on scope and dependencies.
2. **Phase Planning**: Breaking work into clear phases helps manage complexity.
