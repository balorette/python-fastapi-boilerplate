- [ ] Add docstrings/validation for new service methods

### 3. Migrate to Ruff Tooling üîÑ IN PROGRESS
- [x] Configure Ruff in `pyproject.toml`
- [x] Update lint scripts/docs
- [ ] Align pre-commit/CI to Ruff (pending)

### 4. Update Project Configuration üîÑ IN PROGRESS
- [x] Python 3.12 across docs, docker, tooling
- [x] Dependency refresh (`bcrypt>=4.0.1`, etc.)
- [ ] Modernize type hints to PEP 604/PEP 563 patterns
- [ ] Verify pytest async settings align with new fixtures

### 5. Add Strawberry GraphQL API ‚ö†Ô∏è PENDING

- [ ] Protect admin-sensitive routes
- [ ] Add test coverage for allowed/blocked paths

## Phase 2 ‚Äì Enterprise Enhancements (Upcoming)

### Rate Limiting & Abuse Protection

- [ ] Define per-endpoint quotas (login, auth, general API)
- [ ] Bubble up standardized 429 responses

### Caching Layer
- [ ] Introduce FastAPI-cache backed by Redis
- [ ] Cache read-heavy repository queries with invalidation rules
- [ ] Observe hit/miss metrics

### Monitoring & Observability

- [ ] Instrument OpenTelemetry traces for auth flows
- [ ] Track critical business metrics (logins/day, provider mix)

## Phase 3 ‚Äì Advanced Features (Backlog)

### Multi-Provider OAuth Expansion
- [ ] Extend provider factory to support Microsoft Entra ID and Okta
- [ ] Add provider-specific configuration blocks in settings
- [ ] Write migrations for new provider metadata fields
- [ ] Cover new providers with integration tests & docs

### Security Hardening
